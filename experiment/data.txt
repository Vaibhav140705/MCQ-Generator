Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI,[1] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.[2][3][4] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[5][6] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts. Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs).
